# Blog Post Creation Mono Repo Project

Welcome to the mono repo project for creating blog posts! This project provides a comprehensive solution for managing blog posts, including server-side logic, authentication, and CRUD operations for four different models.

## Overview

This project is designed to streamline the process of creating and managing blog posts. It utilizes a mono repo structure, meaning that both the server-side logic and frontend components are contained within a single repository. This allows for easier code organization and management.

### Features

- **Server-Side Logic:** The server-side logic has been pre-generated, providing a solid foundation for building out the blog post creation functionality.
- **Authentication:** User authentication is integrated into the project, ensuring secure access to the blog post creation system.
- **CRUD Operations:** CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are implemented for four different models, offering full control over blog post data.

## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these setup instructions:

1. **Environment Configuration:** Modify the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the necessary environment variables according to your environment requirements.
2. **Initialize npm:** Run `npm install` in both the root project directory and inside the `frontend` folder to install the project dependencies.

## Running the Project

Once the setup is complete, you can run the project using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
This command will start the development server, allowing you to access the blog post creation system in your browser. It will open the authenticaiton page sinup first and login next to enter

Project Structure
The project follows a optimized solution to ensure clarity and maintainability. Here's an overview of the main directories:

server: Contains all server-side logic, including route definitions, controllers, and middleware.
frontend: Houses the frontend components of the project, including UI elements and client-side logic.
